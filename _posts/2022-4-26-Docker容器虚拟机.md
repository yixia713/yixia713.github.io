容器、Docker和虚拟机的区别、定义及Docker的安装使用。

<!-- more -->

## How Docker downloads the image of a container
- To Download an image
```
$ sudo docker pull busybox
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/busybo
```
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
    
- To see a list of all images on your system

`sudo docker images`

## How to run a command in a new container
- Run a command

`docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]`

例如：
```
$ sudo docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
2db29710123e: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:10d7d58d5ebd2a652f4d93fdd86da8f265f5318c6a73cc5b6a9798ff6d2b2e67
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
```
1. the Docker client finds the image (hello-word in this case)
2. loads up the container
3. runs a command in that container.

- Run more than one commands

`sudo docker run -it busybox sh `

`-it` attaches us to an interactive tty in the container

## How to delete a container
```
$ sudo docker ps -a
Find the container ID and copy it
$ sudo rm <Container ID>
```
